          <h2>Why Service Businesses Need Robot SEO</h2>
          <p>
            Service businesses face unique challenges when AI systems evaluate their websites. Unlike product companies with clear inventory and specifications, service businesses must communicate value propositions, expertise, and trust indicators that AI systems can understand and confidently reference.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="section-anchor">
          <h2>The Service Business Context</h2>
          <p><strong>Discovery Dependence</strong></p>
          <p>
            Service businesses typically rely heavily on organic discovery. Potential customers research providers, compare options, and evaluate credibility before making contact. AI systems increasingly mediate this discovery process.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Trust and Credibility Requirements</strong></p>
          <p>
            Service purchases involve higher risk than product purchases. Customers need confidence in provider expertise and reliability. AI systems must understand and validate these trust indicators to make recommendations.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Geographic and Market Specificity</strong></p>
          <p>
            Many service businesses serve specific geographic markets or industry niches. AI systems need clear context about service areas, specializations, and target markets to make appropriate recommendations.
          </p>

        <div className="section-anchor">
          <h2>Common Technical Challenges for Service Businesses</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Vague Entity Definition</strong></p>
          <p>
            Many service business websites fail to clearly define what the business is, what it does, and who it serves. AI systems require explicit entity definition to understand and categorize businesses properly.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
            Example: A website might say "we help businesses grow" without specifying the services provided, business types served, or geographic scope.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Inconsistent Service Descriptions</strong></p>
          <p>
            Service businesses often describe their offerings differently across pages, creating confusion for AI systems attempting to understand the complete service portfolio.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
            Example: Marketing services might be described as "digital marketing," "online advertising," "marketing strategy," and "marketing consulting" across different pages without clarifying relationships.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Poor Information Architecture</strong></p>
          <p>
            Service websites frequently organize information around internal business structure rather than customer needs or logical service categories, making AI system navigation and understanding difficult.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
            Example: Pages organized by employee roles rather than service types or customer problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="section-anchor">
          <h2>Why AI Systems Struggle with Service Businesses</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Abstract Value Propositions</strong></p>
          <p>
            Services often involve abstract benefits that are difficult for AI systems to parse and validate. Websites must translate these benefits into concrete, machine-readable terms.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Relationship-Based Value</strong></p>
          <p>
            Many service businesses emphasize relationships, experience, and intangible qualities. AI systems need structured information to understand and communicate these differentiators.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Complex Service Combinations</strong></p>
          <p>
            Service businesses often provide multiple related services or customized combinations. AI systems require clear categorization and relationship definitions to understand the complete offering.
